# Introduction

From the Covid-19, on this day people around the world need to adapt themselves to survive and avoid
the virus. Some restaurants cannot open because of the economic downturn, so many people decide to
cook by themselves at home. However, the problem may occur because this is a starting point for some
people or some people need to find a new menu to cook for the exotic dish. The important thing is
ingredients, sometimes we donâ€™t know what we can make from the existing ingredients in the refrigerator.

Therefore, we decided to create a mobile application with the cooking community to solve the problem.
The application is open for all people to add the food recipe on the application for the other people to use
them. This application is a community base and it will try to recommend the menu to users by the
ingredient and preference of the user by using a decision tree algorithm. Initially, we will implement this
application for a small group of people and will add more features to cover all needs in the future

## Features
